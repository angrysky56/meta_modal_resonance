# Experimental Design for Meta-Modal Resonance Theory

This document outlines the experimental framework for testing hypotheses derived from the Meta-Modal Resonance Theory (MMRT) using our computational implementation.

## 1. Research Questions and Hypotheses

### Primary Research Question

**How does dynamic integration across hedonic, eudaimonic, and transcendent processing modalities contribute to the construction of robust meaning structures in cognitive systems?**

### Specific Hypotheses

1. **Integration Hypothesis**: Agents capable of adaptive oscillation between the three modalities will develop more coherent and resilient meaning structures than agents primarily operating within a single modality.

2. **Context-Sensitivity Hypothesis**: Optimal oscillation patterns between modalities will vary based on environmental context, with no single pattern being universally optimal.

3. **Developmental Hypothesis**: The capacity for sophisticated modal integration will follow a predictable developmental trajectory with identifiable stages.

4. **Resilience Hypothesis**: Integrated meaning structures will demonstrate greater stability under perturbation than meaning structures derived primarily from single modalities.

5. **Social Propagation Hypothesis**: Meaning structures with balanced modal integration will propagate more effectively in multi-agent systems than single-modality structures.

## 2. Experimental Series

### Experiment 1: Modal Optimization vs. Integration

**Objective**: Compare meaning construction in single-modality optimizers versus adaptive integrators

**Independent Variables**:

**Methodology**:
1. Create populations of each agent type (n=50 per type)
2. Expose each population to identical sequences of environmental inputs
3. Measure meaning structure metrics at regular intervals
4. Apply standardized perturbations and measure recovery trajectories
5. Compare metrics across agent types using statistical analysis

**Expected Results**:
- Modal integrators will show lower initial meaning metrics but higher long-term stability
- Single-modality optimizers will show context-specific advantages but general fragility
- Integration advantages will be most pronounced in volatile environments

### Experiment 2: Oscillation Pattern Analysis

**Objective**: Identify optimal patterns of modal oscillation in different contexts

**Independent Variables**:

**Methodology**:
1. Create multi-agent networks with varied compositions
2. Introduce "seed" meaning structures of different types
3. Track propagation, modification, and adoption patterns
4. Analyze network-level emergent properties
5. Measure stability of collectively constructed meaning

**Expected Results**:
- Integrated structures will show different propagation patterns than single-modality structures
