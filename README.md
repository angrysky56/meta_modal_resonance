# Meta-Modal Resonance Theory: Computational Framework

## Overview

This repository implements a computational framework for modeling the "Meta-Modal Resonance Theory" (MMRT) of meaning-construction in human consciousness. The theory proposes that profound meaning emerges through the dynamic integration of three fundamental experiential modalities:

1. **Hedonic Satisfaction Algorithms** - Processing related to immediate rewards, pleasure, and pain-avoidance
2. **Eudaimonic Purpose Functions** - Processing related to growth, development, purpose, and virtuous action
3. **Transcendent Connection Networks** - Processing related to boundary dissolution and integration with larger systems

The computational framework simulates how these three processing modes interact within individual agents and across multi-agent systems to create emergent meaning structures that are more robust than those produced by any single modality alone.

## Philosophical Foundation

### Theoretical Premise

The Meta-Modal Resonance Theory posits that meaning emerges not from optimizing any single experiential modality, but through their temporal-dynamic integration across different phenomenological states. Consciousness achieves meaning through oscillatory harmonics between:

- Strategic immersion in hedonic states that fulfill biological imperatives (dopaminergic reward activation)
- Sustained engagement with teleological development vectors that extend the self across time (eudaimonic growth trajectories)
- Periodic dissolution of ego-boundaries enabling network integration with transpersonal information fields (transcendent resonance patterns)

### Computational Semantics of Integrated Meaning

The computational model implements three core mechanisms:

1. **Autopoietic Oscillation** - Dynamic movement between processing modes based on contextual variables and developmental stage
2. **Temporal Integration** - The capacity to weave disparate experiential modalities into coherent narrative structures with emergent properties
3. **Recursive Self-Modification** - Continual refinement of the integration parameters themselves based on feedback from lived experience

### Philosophical Integration

This framework provides a computational hermeneutic through which diverse philosophical traditions can be understood as emphasizing different aspects of the same integrated system:

- **Buddhist traditions**: Algorithm for modal integration through metacognitive observation that collapses separation between modalities
- **Epicureanism vs. Stoicism**: Competing optimization functions within the same computational framework
- **Existentialism**: Meta-algorithmic approach recognizing human capacity to define integration parameters
- **Virtue Ethics**: Teleological feedback system based on practice, narrative, and tradition
- **Process Philosophy**: Dynamic systems integration of prehension, concrescence, and objective immortality

## Research Questions & Hypotheses

1. **Primary Hypothesis**: Agents that develop adaptive oscillation between hedonic, eudaimonic, and transcendent processing modes will demonstrate greater meaning resilience (measured through narrative coherence and identity stability) than agents optimizing any single modality.

2. **Research Questions**:
   - What oscillatory patterns between modalities produce the most robust meaning structures?
   - How do different environmental contexts affect optimal modal integration?
   - What developmental trajectories lead to sophisticated integration capabilities?
   - How does inter-agent interaction affect meaning construction processes?
   - To what extent can meaning structures survive catastrophic disruptions to one modal system?

## Methodological Approach

### Computational Framework

The simulation extends existing agent-based emotional modeling with:

1. **Modal Region Specification**: Dedicated regions for hedonic, eudaimonic, and transcendent processing
2. **Oscillatory Controller**: Metacognitive mechanism governing transitions between processing modes
3. **Integration Metrics**: Measures to quantify modal balance, temporal integration, and meaning resilience
4. **Environmental Simulation**: Variable contexts creating different demands on agents' processing systems
5. **Developmental Modeling**: Longitudinal simulation of how integration capability evolves

### Implementation Strategy

The implementation builds upon existing agent-based emotional simulation frameworks with:

1. `MetaModalAgent` class that extends standard agents with modal processing capabilities
2. `MeaningStructure` class representing the output of integrated modal processing
3. `OscillatoryController` managing dynamic transitions between processing modes
4. `EnvironmentalContext` creating variable demands on the system
5. `IntegrationMetrics` providing quantitative measures of meaning construction

### Experimental Design

The computational experiments will test:

1. **Modal Optimization vs. Integration**: Compare agents optimizing single modalities vs. adaptive integration
2. **Oscillation Patterns**: Test different patterns of modal shifting (frequency, sequence, context-sensitivity)
3. **Perturbation Resilience**: Measure meaning structure stability following disruptions
4. **Developmental Trajectories**: Model long-term acquisition of integration capabilities
5. **Social Propagation**: Analyze how meaning structures spread in multi-agent systems
